# Data Persistence Lab

In this lab we will cover Data Persistence in the Apple ecosystem. Data persistence is how apps save data for future use. There are several ways to accomplish data persistence and in this activity we will learn 5 methods. 

We will begin with a starter app and refactor it five times to cover each persistence method. While it it possible to jump in at any level we recommend doing all of them to understand the pros and cons of each. Feel free to go at your own pace and work with others.
